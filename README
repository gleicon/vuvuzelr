This is the code behind http://vuvuzelr.7co.cc, a simple filtering proxy built on Sinatra and Nokogiri.
There are two versions, one with no cache and other using Redis as cache. I am running it behind NGINX using 4 thin instances.
Simply move it to your app folder, configure nginx with the provided sites-avaliable config file (for debian and ubuntu), use thin with its init.d script and be happy.

Enjoy
